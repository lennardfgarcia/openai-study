# OpenAI Studies

This is my repository for testing out the Python scripts used for my OpenAI studies.  For my studies, I am using the OpenAI courses available on KodeKloud.com. I believe that AI and MLOps are key DevOps skills that will be needed for the future, and I hope to keep my skills future-proof by studying these key skills.
